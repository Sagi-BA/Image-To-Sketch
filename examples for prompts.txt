Human realism: "A close-up portrait of a weathered elderly fisherman with deep wrinkles, wearing a yellow raincoat and knit cap, against a stormy sea background."
Landscape/scenery: "A serene Japanese zen garden at twilight, with carefully raked sand patterns, moss-covered rocks, and cherry blossom trees in full bloom."
Incorporating text: "A mystical forest clearing where wisps of fog spell out the words 'Magic Awaits' in flowing, ethereal lettering between ancient trees."
Weird and absurd: "A steampunk-inspired octopus riding a unicycle made of clockwork gears, juggling neon cubes while floating in a bubble tea sea."
